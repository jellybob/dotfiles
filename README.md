These are managed using GNU Stow, which is probably available
as a package for your operating system. Install it, and then
run `stow` from this directory, assuming you've cloned it directly
into your home directory.

## Dependencies

### Fedora

`dnf install stow git vim`
`pip3 install powerline`

### Ubuntu

`apt install -y stow git vim build-essential`

## Recommended Font

I recommend Iosevka - https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka
